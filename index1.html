<font color="#5A5A5A" size="5"><b>Do you feel like you are the laziest person on the planet? Do you constantly feel like you are procrastinating? Do you regret not doing what you know you are supposed to do? Don't worry you are not alone. See your real problem isn't that you are lazy. You are not lazy my friend, you just lack the single most important thing for achieving success, that is FOCUS. See I'm not here to give you a planned path to your goals. All I will do, is assign to you a task. Yes, a task. Click on the button below and you'll be directed to a page where you will first type in the distractions you have one by one, but it isn't enough, every distraction you type in there, you yourself will have to introspect and find a way to tackle it. All by yourself. Now there will be a very small portion of idiots out there saying this is useless if I don't give a solution. Well sure if you are that stupid and foolish that you don't know yourself. You can find a million solutions on the internet. I want you to think, when was the last time you sat and listed all your problems and legitimate found a solution for it by thinking yourself.
